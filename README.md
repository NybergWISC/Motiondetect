# Motiondetect
Motion detection code using OpenCV (2.4.9) and python(2.7)

Key Points:

  - "editedstreamdelayed.py" is the most recent/best version that I uploaded on this repo, but it still has a few issues that I patched on a version that is not saved here.  
  - "conf.json" holds contains a lot of finetuning settings if the detection is not working
    *  This program takes a lot of processing power to run, but lowering fps should help
